## Upgrade notes

### v3.3.0

* The `ol.events.condition.mouseMove` function was replaced by `ol.events.condition.pointerMove` (see [#3281](https://github.com/openlayers/ol3/pull/3281)). For example, if you use `ol.events.condition.mouseMove` as the condition in a `Select` interaction then you now need to use `ol.events.condition.pointerMove`:

  ```js
  var selectInteraction = new ol.interaction.Select({
    condition: ol.events.condition.pointerMove
    // â€¦
  });
  ```
